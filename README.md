A main aspect of thhe game of football is finding players before they become stars (or too expensive). For clubs that want to find players and determine a reasonable price for them there are many databases filled with statistics on the players and estimated values. A well-know website that does this is https://www.transfermarkt.com. However, the estimated values are often subjective, unclear and potentially inaccurate. To test this statement, we scraped playing statistics to determine prices for players and found that the estimated price generated by transfermarkt (also scraped) matched the the playing data. So, in general the players were reasonably priced but clubs are interested in the best value players (ie. outliers).

Therefore, another aspect of our research was finding players with similar statistical profiles using unsupervised learning. Within this we were able to see that clubs could use this to find alternatives to a prospective player that they are searching for. If the replacement is cheaper/better value, then they could pick him. 

In conclusion, with the use of webscraping, we were able to gather a plethora of useful insights into the football transfer market and football teams could potentially do similar to find the next Lionel Messi.
